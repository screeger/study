          How does the problem determine aesthetic qualities <strong>of the playground</strong>?
          What are the material choices that will be visible to the people using the <strong>playground</strong>?
          What is the desired size in relation to other solutions around and the environment it will function in?

        <p>Here are some thought starters:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide descriptors that help guide what it could look like.</li>
          <li>What are tangible characteristics of the solution?</li>
          <li>What is its size in relation to its environment?</li>
          <li>What are the potential material descriptors without specifically stating what type of material is used? </li>
